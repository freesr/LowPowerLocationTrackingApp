The goal of this Project is to understand how to use location tracking and Maps to build a
realtime low-energy tracking application. The app only needs to work outdoors. However, here
is the catch. The app should be low power consuming. Hence, it cannot just use GPS all the
time to provide realtime location information to the user. The solution is to use a combination
of low-power sensors such as the accelerometer in combination with the GPS unit to provide low
power realtime tracking. The algorithm that combines the accelerometer data with the GPS
data to minimize the use of the GPS unit is for you to develop.
